Every single day hardworking Americans labor tirelessly, working to support their families, to create a better life for their children than they had.
Some even live paycheck to paycheck, unsure where they are going to get their next meal.

We all know that the economy is rigged, and it is certainly not in your favor.
  Millionaires and billionaires hide their money overseas, avoiding their fair share of taxes.
  Millionaires and billionaires funnel their money through loopholes in the tax code.

  Economists agree: Not only would American workers benefit, but so would the American economy.
